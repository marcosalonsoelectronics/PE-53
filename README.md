Files associated to video PE-53: How to Implement an Isolated PI Compensator using a TL431

Available at: https://youtu.be/zL41maEQkgk

This video explains how to implement an isolated PI compensator using a TL431. First, the operation and modelling of the optocoupler is presented.
The frequency response of the PI compensator is obtained by LTspice simulations. The operation of the compensator is tested in a current-mode-controlled buck converter. LTspice simulations are performed to verify the correct operation of the compensator.
